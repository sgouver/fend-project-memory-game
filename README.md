## Instructions

The project is a memory game, with a chess theme :
Rules :
- A user selects a card and opens a chess piece
- If the second card is similar then the two chess pieces stay on top.
- The game ends when the user finds all the eight different matching compilations.
- A modal pop-up window open up to show the score of the user.

Score calculation:
- Score is based on the player Moves
- If there are more than 16, a star is removed.
- If there are more than 30, a second star is removed.

## Contributing

- Add a keyboard function for immediate restart, after hitting the "r" key.
- Alter the timer function to start when the first card is opened, not on the load.
- Create a more complicated ranking system with final time correlation.
